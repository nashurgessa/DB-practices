## Project 1: E-commerce Retail Store Application

### Overview

This project involves developing a comprehensive database system for an **e-commerce*** retail store. The focus will be on creating a robust and scalable database that can handle various aspects of an online store, including product listing, order management, user management, and transaction processing.


### Key Concepts:

- **Database Design and Normalization:** Develop a highly normalized database schema to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- ***Relational Schema:*** Create a detailed relational schema that depicts the relationships between different entities such as products, users, orders, payment details, and more.
- ***MySQL Queries:*** Implement complex SQL queries for CRUD operations, search functionality, and joining multiple tables.
- ***Transactions:*** Ensure that the database handles transactions securely, maintaining consistency and integrity of data across operations.
- ***Indexing:*** Use indexing to improve the performance of queries, especially for large datasets.
- ***Big Data Considerations:*** Plan for scalability by considering how the system might handle large volumes of data and high transaction volumes.


### Project Deliverables:

- Design documentation including ER diagrams and relational schemas.
- Implementation of the database in MySQL with all required tables and relationships.
- A set of advanced SQL queries demonstrating CRUD operations, transactions, and join operations.
- A report on indexing strategies implemented and their impact on query performance.
- **Optional:** Prototype of a web front-end using a simple Java servlet or Python Flask or Django application to demonstrate the database.

## Project 2: Movie Streaming Service Application

### Overview

This project focuses on building a database system for a movie streaming service, similar to **Netflix** or **Hulu**. The database should manage large datasets of users, movies, subscriptions, views, and ratings efficiently.

### Key Concepts:

- ***Database Design:*** Develop a database schema that supports the storage and retrieval of movie data, user profiles, subscription information, and viewing history.
- ***Normalization:*** Apply normalization rules to ensure minimal redundancy and maintain data integrity.
- ***Relational Database Management:*** Create a comprehensive relational database that includes tables for storing movies, users, genres, directors, and actors.
- ***Transaction Management:*** Handle transactions in scenarios like subscription payments and movie rentals.
- ***Indexing:*** Implement effective indexing to optimize searches across a potentially vast database of movies and users.
- ***Big Data:*** Discuss strategies for managing and querying large datasets effectively using MySQL.

### Project Deliverables:

- Detailed database design documents, including ER diagrams and normalized tables.
- Implementation of the database schema in MySQL.
- Complex SQL queries that demonstrate data manipulation, complex joins, and transactional integrity.
- Analysis of the use of indexing and its effects on the performance of the system.
- ***Optional:*** A simple NodeJs, Java or Python application to demonstrate basic functionalities of the streaming service with a front-end website.

### Submission Requirements:
***Written Report:*** A detailed report including all aspects of the database design, implementation, and a discussion on the challenges faced and solutions implemented.
***Code and Database Files:*** All source code and MySQL database files used in the project.
***Presentation Slides:*** Slides for the final presentation.
